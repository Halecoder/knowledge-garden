# About Spaces

Spaces are one of the most important parts of ACCESS:  Whenever you have something big in your life, deploy a space and set up MAPS (MOCs, Areas, Projects, Support notes).

"Spaces" is more flexible than "projects" and more versatile than "areas".

Spaces contain both.

Spaces are the biggest spaces of effort in your work and personal life.

Here are other examples of when you can deploy a new space:

- shared folders for collaboration
- special folders to share publicly
- big hard-to-define things
- and whatever else demands its own space!
